# üå± Renewable Energy Sector Classifier & Emission Impact Estimator

This project uses machine learning to classify U.S. renewable energy consumption patterns into economic sectors (e.g., Commercial, Industrial, Electric Power) and estimates the **carbon emissions avoided** due to renewable energy usage.

Built with the goal of supporting researchers and policymakers, this tool offers both predictive power and environmental impact insights ‚Äî all through an intuitive, interactive web interface.
